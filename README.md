# First-Semester-Final

This is the final exam project for Computer Science I. You will have 5 days in the computer lab to work on this. You will begin Monday December 12th and finish Friday December 16th. You are encouraged to work with eachother but you are responsible for your own repository.

You will be assessed based on the rubric that I have shared with you through Showbie. On the day of the final exam I will interview you each individually on your work. With a print out copy of your code I will point to specific sections and ask you to explain your reasoning for how it works or potentially challenge you to correct any errors that exist.

## List of Subtle and Not Subtle Facts
  -  There are 3 separate README files.
  -  There are 3 separate classes to create.
  -  1 file for each class.
  -  Here is another bullet point emphasizing how logical that is...
  -  You must upload all 3 files to receive full credit.

## Tips
  -  Bring your notes and worksheets. You have all the information for each function, you may need to do some research on old topics.
  -  Compare and contrast your code with your classmates. If your code was incorrect, write down an explanation for why someone else's code is correct.
  -  Plan and work with classmates after school. Discuss potential solutions to the challegnges.
